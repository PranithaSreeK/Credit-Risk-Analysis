# Credit Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts loan default risk using applicant financial and credit history.
A Logistic Regression model was trained on a synthetic dataset to classify defaulters
and generate applicant-level risk scores.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression

## Project Workflow
1. Data generation and preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC)
5. Risk score generation
